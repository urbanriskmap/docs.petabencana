## Versioning


The API is versioned with a version string specified in the base URL that can be incremented independently from other APIs.

Using the newest available API is always encouraged.

These changes are considered backwards compatible and will not require the version string to be incremented:

* Adding properties to JSON objects

* Adding new parameters

* Changing the number of items returned in a single listing request

* The structure or length of identifiers generated by the API

* Changing error messages

These changes are considered backwards incompatible and will require the version string to be incremented:

* Removing properties from JSON objects

* Changing an API's URL structure

The current version is v1
