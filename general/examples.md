## Examples

The APIs all feature worked examples with sample HTTPS calls.  As we need to pass authentication headers in some cases to be able to connect we cannot run these in a web browser.  Each example shows a [cURL](https://curl.haxx.se/docs/manpage.html) command which is available on Windows, Max or Linux.  Note that for protected routes you will need to insert your own JWT token for these to work.

If you are not comfortable with the command line or generally prefer a user interface then [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) is a fantastic free tool for experimenting with APIs.
