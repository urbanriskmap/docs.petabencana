By default the Petabencana API returns [JSON](http://www.w3schools.com/json/) for all calls and expects any POST requests to supply JSON formatted bodies unless otherwise advised.  [UTF-8 encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8) is used on all requests and responses.

Where Geographic data is returned this is will be encoded as [TopoJSON](https://github.com/topojson/topojson/wiki) by default.  [GeoJson](http://geojson.org/) is also supported if required, by supplying `format=topojson in the API call.  More details of this can be found in the specific API route documentation.  In addition to TopoJSON and GeoJson we provide a public feed of real-time flood information using the `[`Common Alerting Protocol`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Alerting_Protocol)` standard.`
