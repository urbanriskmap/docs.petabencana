### Request Format

| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| cardId | Unique identifier of the card we wish to work with, this is generated by the system when the initial card is created (required) | String (7 to 14 characters) | Yes


| Attribute | Description | Format | Required |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| card_data | User data collected in card interface | JSON | Yes |

#### Note on card_data
Card data requires the object `report_type` to exist. Where `disaster_type` is set to 'flood' then the object `flood_depth` should also exist adjacent to `report_type`. Where the `disaster_type` is 'prep' then `report_type` should be one of the types as specified in server config.js.

For example a card with flood data including flood_depth:

```javascript
  "disaster_type": "flood",
  "card_data":{
    "report_type": "flood",
    "flood_depth": 50
  }
```

Or, a card with pre-flood data report regarding a drain.

```javascript
  "disaster_type": "prep",
  "card_data":{
    "report_type":"drain"
  }
```

### POST /cards/:cardId/images

POST an image to a card report, this must be done after the card report has been created and only one image can exist for a given card.  The image is uploaded in binary format and it is important to tell the server which [MIME type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_type) is being uploaded.  The following MIME types are accepted:

- `image/gif`
- `image/jpeg`
- `image/png`

If this information is not supplied an HTTP error `415 Unsupported Media Type` will be returned by the server.

NOTE: After an image is submitted a server-side process shrinks the image to a standard size and there may be a small time lag of a few seconds before the image goes "live".

{% sample lang="https" %}

Here is a simple call to POST a new image:

```https
TODO```

{% common %}
Image was successfully uploaded:

```json
TODO
```

{% endmethod %}
