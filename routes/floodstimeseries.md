## Floods Time Series

Time series of flooded areas \(see [Floods endpoint](/routes/floods.md) documentation\), presented as the count of flood affected areas every hour within the specified time period. Count is recorded alongside an hourly timestamp in ISO8601 format at UTC+0.

Currently this data is only available for Jakarta.

### Request Format

| Query Parameter | Description | Format | Required |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| start | Start time for timeseries period | String in ISO 8601 format \(YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss+ZZZZ | Yes |
| end | End time for timeseries period | String in ISO 8601 format \(YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss+ZZZZ | Yes |

Note that time zone must be specified as +/- UTC offset which will require HTML character encoding \(e.g. +0700 becomes %2B0700\).
